# this is our thing.

I created this webshrine&mdash;my first attempt at one, at least&mdash;during my hyperfixation on *The Social Network* and my favorite ship from it, Mark/Eduardo, somewhere around 2016-2017. I was ambitious in the pages I would write but never really had the focus or energy to, and now I don't really care to anymore, so I consider this project archived.

Despite this, I'm quite satisfied with the design and how I'd planned on displaying the content if I'd written it. I'd only really written character analyses and other things that were more indulgent to me, but I like the idea that I would've written more insane narrative analyses for them as well. 

However, I don't want to make it seem like my shipping a fictional Mark Zuckerberg with his ex-business partner is meant to support IRL Zuckerberg in any way. He can suck it. I like Jesse Eisenberg (and Andrew Garfield) better as people, anyway.
