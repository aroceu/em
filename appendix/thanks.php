<p>I've been meaning to make a Mark/Eduardo shrine&mdash;originally fanlisting, when I was still more interested in the fanlisting aspect of it&mdash;for since I <i>really</i> got into <i>The Social Network</i>, which was August 2015. This is also hilarious because the fandom itself has been dead since as late as 2014 (though most will probably claim 2013), and I myself did actually watch the movie when it came out on DVD, in March 2011. So here we are in 2017.</p>

<p>In addition to being the juggernaut ship of the former fandom, it has retained my interest for one and a half years so far, which is somewhat impressive considering my own attention span and ability to jump from interest to interest. I suppose it's because of the lack of pressure to interact with others in this now-dead fandom, and really the only person I yell regularly to about this movie (and Mark/Eduardo) anymore is <b>Cathy</b>&mdash;who, well, thank you. Also for helping me add to the song playlist. We cry endlessly to each other and it's my favorite thing ever.</p>

<p>Much thanks also to <b>Julie</b>, <b>Christie</b>, and <b>Ivy</b> for putting up with my screaming when I send you TSN thoughts at like 11 in the morning or 11 at night, in two thousand-fucking-seventeen. You make the void shout back to me even when it's been over six years, and the echo is always appreciated.</p>

<p>And finally thank you to real life Mark Zuckerberg for existing and ruining my life with your dumb ex-business partner but please don't find this. Real life Eduardo you better not find this either. I'm serious. Stop googling yourselves.</p>
