<p class="intro"><i>As depicted by Andrew Garfield</i>
<br />19 March 1982 | Jewish-Brazilian, from Miami, Florida | <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="tooltip">Bisexual <span class="tooltiptext">(personal headcanon/preference)</span></a> | ESTP 1w9 <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="tooltip">Hufflepuff <span class="tooltiptext">(Primary Slytherin, Model Ravenclaw)</a></span></p>

<p>It is hard to analyze Eduardo not relative to Mark. It is hard to analyze Eduardo's character in general, as the movie is solely his emotional testimony, and doesn't really delve into his character the way it does Mark's or even Sean's. Eduardo is specifically presented to us in an emotive, loyal, and sympathetic way that it's easy for the viewer to see him as simply that&mdash;a loyal friend who got screwed over.</p>

<p>But there is more to him than that, the same way there is more to Mark than just being an asshole, or that there's more to any other character or person than just a single autobiographical account of a narrative of their life. Much of Eduardo's non-Mark reliant characterization is simply implicated in the movie <strike>(and further expanded in fanwork)</strike>, as in most scenes he is with Mark, so we're exposed to what looks like his heart most of the time.</p>

<p>And it's intentional. It's a strategy&mdash;both in terms of the movie's storytelling, with the depositions, but also from Eduardo himself, in that the movie <i>is</i> one long deposition and Eduardo appeals to us. That's why he won the court case. Of course, he was wronged in the worst way, and he does come from a place of true emotion.</p>

<p>But that doesn't mean that every second of it wasn't intentional.</p>

<img src="eduardo/2.png" class="banner">

<h3>&ldquo;Do you really think this is such a good idea?&rdquo;</h3>

<p>It's not to say that Eduardo manipulates the viewer through the movie's storytelling, or that he's particularly manipulative in the whole movie itself. He does genuinely care about people and wants to be a good person. He's supportive of Mark and gets a girlfriend within the "past" narrative of the movie, though we can tell that he's not super into her, even though he manages to stay in the relationship for as long as he does. Eduardo appeals to businesspeople; he appeals to the lawyers when it matters; he discusses his father's approval.</p>

<p>And yet there's a strange sense of his caring and sympathy being distanced and withheld unless it really matters. Garfield's acting makes Eduardo look more open when he's with around Mark&mdash;but only Mark.</p>

<p>For Eduardo, while he is intensely aware of and cares about emotions, they are not the priority. If nothing else, <u>he seeks to be in people's good books</u> at face value and nothing more. It is the kind of superficial compartmentalization where he knows how to be a good and kind person if he wants to&mdash;he welcomes Christy's compliments on the facebook, he's silent but amused when the kids after the Bill Gates lecture approach Mark, he responds to Phoenix hazing questions with mostly confidence, he is workable and quick when the restructuring lawyers meet with him. It's the passive social charisma that he holds (and that Mark lacks) that makes him look like a friendly and sympathetic person, that it looks like his emotions aren't being withheld.</p>

<p>And certainly the charisma becomes even more blatantly obvious when Mark isn't around. Before Mark arrives to Caribbean Night, he's having a comfortable good time at a lame AEPi party when he's decked out in a Hawaiian shirt and sombrero&mdash;certainly not his typical wardrobe, but not something that he has any visible insecurities with. Charisma and intentional appeal is one of Eduardo's top priorities, as we can see when he maintains the meeting with <strike>Aaron Sorkin</strike> the ad executive even when Mark is being troublesome. He suggests Palo Alto because it's a quick attention-getting strategy, he talks to his own lawyer and Gage in a comfortable and easy way&mdash;the only exception to this rule, it seems, is Sean Parker.</p>

<p>Here lies another dimension of Eduardo we only get glimpses of&mdash;he is <u>fast-paced and impulsive</u>. Not in the way where Mark's mind is always working towards new ideas and firing off in every which way direction&mdash;Eduardo, on the other hand, has an internal set of values that he'll immediately jump to before his chips are even at threat of being taken down.</p>

<p>But more on the gambling analogies later.</p>

<p>Eduardo seeks to live an honest life (much like Mark), which also tears at his want to be appealing. When Sean enters the picture, we see no sign of Eduardo even giving Sean a chance&mdash;at face value, he is effortlessly polite, but even then Eduardo pitches in with pettiness ("But they won the case." "Thanks, that was mine.") getting increasingly agitated and nitpicky in a way that almost seems to emulate Mark ("Okay, but we know that fish don't really weigh that much, right? That would have to be a <i>really</i> big fish and a <i>very</i> strong guy.) </p>

<p>And it's not just Sean that brings out this side of Eduardo. Eduardo makes attempts when his and Christy's relationship is falling apart&mdash;but they're superficial attempts, he just complains to Mark and then gets her a silk scarf, as if that would help things. And if Eduardo <i>were</i> as emotional as his testimony makes him sound, he and Mark wouldn't have yelled at each other the way they did, clashing in idea and action rather than having actual issue with their relationship. Beneath his smile and nice-looking face, Eduardo has a lot of barbed wire that will poke out in bits if prodded at too much. </p>

<p>So why does he look so loyal and giving? Because he is; he believes in things that have promise. Facebook, ads, <i>the lawsuit</i>. <strike>Mark.</strike> But this is because much of Eduardo's mindset is that one of a <u>gameplayer</u>&mdash;seeking a means to an end, once that end is established.</p>

<p>Of course, this raises the whole narrative of the movie in a different light, and it also sees Eduardo in a different light. Eduardo does things in the best way as he sees them&mdash;advertising, staying in New York all summer even when Mark tells him otherwise, settling for Sean owning the percentage of the company that he does. He is quick to evaluate the pros and cons of things as they look on the outside, rarely diving in deeper if he already has the realistic big picture. He briefly deposes at the Winklevoss depositions that makes him look like he's on Mark's side, but is quick to leave when he is no longer needed. He responds with subjective technicality, not anything that feels sincere, from him.</p>

<p>The particular thing about Eduardo's characterization is that it looks like two sides of him are being shown, between the "past" and the depositions. While he is genuinely hurt, everything is now even more deliberate than before, save for the humiliating chicken incident, which he is quick to react to. Eduardo speaks directly to the lawyers if asked a specific question, and otherwise narrates unemotional instances with his back turned. He makes eye contact with Mark several times to make specific, hurtful points&mdash;with Sean, "oops," 0.03%&mdash;and, strangely as the movie makes this look <i>very</i> obvious, but, "I was your only friend. You had one friend," was a direct, emotionally manipulative lie during the deposition. Eduardo knows this. He doesn't do this to hurt Mark with a reminder. He does this because he's just finished recounting the moment that he signed the papers, and now the room full of lawyers needs to know how he feels about it to get him on his side. (Whether or not "My father won't even look at me" is true or used as a strategy or both, is ambiguous&mdash;but certainly not out of the question.)</p>

<p>And here is a bigger picture of Eduardo. This is the one who freezes a bank account after less than twelve hours in California, who doesn't know how to change his relationship status on a website with his name on the masthead, who puts out a fire and bluntly breaks up with his girlfriend within the span of a minute, who takes less than a second to decide to begin a four-year long lawsuit with someone after smashing their computer. And when you add all this to someone who, by anecdote, gambled and made 300k by watching the weather channel, you can see that for someone full of emotion and charm, Eduardo is naturally an oxymoronic reckless strategizer.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;Well, they manage to make money selling pants.&rdquo;</h3>

<img src="eduardo/3.png" class="banner">

<h3>&ldquo;Unless you're the Ballet Theatre of Hartford, the purpose of a business is to make a profit.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Eduardo's three-piece suits are trademark to him&mdash;even when he's hanging out in Mark's dorm, going to a hazing ritual, or attending a lecture full of college casuals, his outfit makes him a stark contrast to his best friend. Interestingly, he is shown to occasionally be wearing jeans (the hackathon, the Phoenix second cut letter), but maybe it's the weekend.</p>

<p>His introductory paragraph is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>EDUARDO SAVERIN, a sweet-looking Brazilian sophomore wearing a three-piece suit is rushing up the stairs two at a time.</blockquote>

<p><i>The Facebook Effect</i> by David Kirkpatrick (the response-sequel to <i>The Accidental Billionaires</i>) cites Eduardo's suits as a dorky business-major element of his personality, but as these are commentaries on the real life persons, it doesn't have to be explanatory. Eduardo could just be an ironic aesthetically-obsessed pretentious fuck, who knows.</p>

<p>It should be noted that when deposing for the meeting that ended in the laptop smash, Eduardo (in the present) makes the following comment:</p>

<blockquote>"I didn't know if I should dress for a party or a business meeting, so I kind of dressed for both."</blockquote>

<p>It's a throwaway line, but it's an interesting comment to make (aside from being a leadup to the sequential events) since there lies heavy implications that he then generally everyday dresses with business intent. He also always carries a briefcase&mdash;in school, to appropriate business meetings, to California. We don't see him with a single backpack, just Blackberrys and briefcases.</p>

<p>Aside from being unconsciously shallow and materialistic, this also makes sense as Eduardo is an economics major, and takes business seriously&mdash;he dives headfirst into that mindset, even where a friendship is concerned. He takes things to court, he has meetings because he evaluates them best. Business is easy because emotion is not (and shouldn't be) involved; if it is, it needs to be in a clear-cut, linear way in his favor.</p>

<p>In a way, this makes Eduardo's whole investment in Facebook look simultaneously foolish but hopeful. Eduardo hears him out&mdash;he says, "That's a good idea." Would he have given Mark the money even if he thought it was a bad idea? There's no way of saying for sure, but even if he did, it's likely that he would've tried to take the reins on the business end the way he still did with Facebook. At least the Little Bighorn worked.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;I can live with that.&rdquo;</h3>

<img src="eduardo/7.png" class="banner">

<h3>&ldquo;Don't screw around with me now.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>There should also be further discussion of the brief comments Eduardo makes about his father:</p>

<blockquote><b>EDUARDO</b><br />
You have no idea what that's going to mean to my father.
<br /><br />
<b>MARK</b><br />
Sure I do.</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;about Eduardo being labeled as the CFO on the masthead.</p>

<p>And, of course, "my father won't even look at me." While it's easy (and not necessarily untrue, in terms of interpretation) to say that just these two lines imply that Eduardo has daddy issues, it's even more accurate to say that it shows that Eduardo's father places a lot of his son's worth in business&mdash;more than that, but in successful business than simple ambition. This could also present where Eduardo's need for validation and superficial acceptance is birthed, though it's not to say that without his father's influenced it wouldn't be naturalized in the first place&mdash;it just adds pressure. But there's still a lot to be interpreted, adding influence on his character in where he's coming from.  </p>

<p>Either way, Eduardo certainly has the mind for business&mdash;his decisions for Facebook, Palo Alto, the Sean Parker meeting, New York, those were all him without any influence by his father. Even if his father's expectations can call into question his major in economics and ambition as a businessman in the first place,  it's made obvious that Eduardo enjoys and is good at making technical decisions; and other than his actual participation in Facebook, knows when something looks promising and how to make calculative decisions the way a businessperson should. Being adept at math&mdash;having a self-made algorithm for ranking chess players that Mark needs to procure from him instead of figuring it himself&mdash;deciding on advertising after a month, observing things as they are on the surface and internally following a path of self-identified guaranteed success&mdash;this also contributes to his lawsuit, even though so much could've happened between the end of the "past" and the beginning of the depositions. Eduardo still knows that he was wronged, and he has the emotional appeal to win. Even if his claim that his father won't look at him for his failed investment in Facebook is true, Eduardo wins the lawsuit and some penance, carefully and well.</p>

<p>And with mentioned interests in the weather, gambling, and chess, the perspective Eduardo has is not just simply business, but also <u>probability</u>, which in itself is a pretty reckless interest. Giving Facebook startup is that, gambling on oil futures based on the weather is that; and, well, chess is that. (More on the chess thing later.) These require a technical mind and are not things that Eduardo singles out as the only situations he approaches with a technical mind; but rather left-brained interests that he enjoys, being left-brain reliant, an interesting contrast to Garfield's demeanor otherwise. He is not artistic or intuitive&mdash;Eduardo is specific, realistic, and direct, with appreciation in other respects.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;Shit, that looks good. That looks really good.&rdquo;</h3>

<h4>Headcanons/Insignificant Details Expanded</h4>
<ul><li>Coming from the tropics (Brazil, Miami, relocating to Singapore), Eduardo really likes humid weather. His skin is also naturally colder and dry, which can also contrast to Mark being from New England and more naturally warm and oily.</li>
<li>He is more amused than fretful at certain people's antics, tunnel vision, inabilities to take care of themselves. Eduardo only gets high-strung about it when it's obviously self-destructive, ridiculous, and/or he knows the certain people well enough.</li>
<li>Eduardo is down for all alcohol, whether cheap beer or champagne or gin and tonic.</li>
<li>He uses proper punctuation and capitalization when online. All the time. Cannot blind-type at all, and usually avoids computers/phones/general technology when drunk.</li>
<li>Even though he disguises it well (with Sean, as usual, the only canonical exception to this), he's totally a secretly judgy person who makes judgments about people all the time.</li>
<li>Like Mark, he is a Star Wars nerd and can twirl a pen with his fingers.</li>
<li>He is a cat person, to parallel Mark <small>(a catlike person)</small> being a dog person.</li>
<li>While Mark codes at his desk, Eduardo often occupies Mark's bed to study.</li>
<li>The ring on his left(?) hand is a family ring.</li>
<li>To him, his interest in meterology is as much of an interest (though acknowledged hobby more) as his business/economic pursuits. Plus, he really likes rain and storms.</li>
<li>He is not naturally technology savvy outside of what is required for his job or classes. He doesn't know how to change his Relationship Status on Facebook&mdash;although he figures it out eventually&mdash;and his cellphone (which is a Blackberry) background is one of the generic default landscape photos because he doesn't care to change it and they're nice-looking anyway.</li>
<li>Garfield says that he thinks Eduardo would be the happiest of all of them after the depositions, being able to carve out a new life in Singapore and settle down and have a kid.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Factually</h4>
<ul><li>Eduardo was not Mark's roommate, but rather lived in Eliot House, which is Kirkland's sister house right next door. The movie shows him living in a single.</li>
<li>The canonical basis of his algorithm for chess players is that in real life, he defeated a chess grandmaster when he was fifteen-years old.</li>
<li>In Harvard, he was a member of the Phoenix and the Harvard Business Investor's Club. His internship during the summer was at the Lehman Brothers.</li>
<li>Between the dilution and the depositions, Eduardo took a year off of school to get the lawsuit sorted; he graduated a year later than he would have originally, but also cum laude.</li>
<li>The movie is actually pretty inconsistent with his age, describing him as a sophomore (by the movie's start he's a junior) and having him fret over getting carded, though he could've just been worried for Christy and Mark. He is a "grade" higher than Mark, Chris, and Dustin.</li>
<li>Eduardo and his family had relocated to Miami when he was thirteen-years old because his father had discovered that Eduardo's name had been on a kidnapping list in Brazil.</li>
<li>The movie is more implicit about it, but even with Eduardo's personal money from gambling oil futures, he already comes from a place of wealth and privilege because of his father's business, and likely inheritance.</li>
