<p class="intro"><i>As depicted by Jesse Eisenberg</i>
<br />14 May 1984 | Jewish, from Westchester, New York | <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="tooltip">Bisexual <span class="tooltiptext">(personal headcanon/preference)</span></a> | INTP 5w4 <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="tooltip">Slytherin <span class="tooltiptext">(Primary Ravenclaw, Model Hufflepuff)</a></span></p>

<p>Mark is introduced to us in the beginning of the movie, in the middle of a date with his girlfriend&mdash;who unceremoniously dumps him, after the first ten minutes running like a trainwreck that the viewer can’t take their eyes off of. After a series of Mark’s misogynistic and condescending comments, Erica Albright, his soon to be ex-girlfriend, grabs his hand and tells him, “You’re going to go through life thinking that girls don’t like you because you’re a nerd, but I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won’t be true.”</p>

<p><big>“It’ll be because you’re an asshole.</big></p>
<p>And here we are with the flaw, the identifier, the ultimatum: Mark Zuckerberg, the asshole.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;They came to me with an idea, I had a better one.&rdquo;</h3>


<img src="mark/2.png" class="banner">

<h3>&ldquo;If you were the inventors of Facebook, you'd have invented Facebook.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Though the movie is told in a somewhat “unreliable narrator” way&mdash;<i>creation myths need a devil</i>&mdash;Mark is defined by his <u>ego and intellect</u>. A representation as such is consistent, from beginning to end, from Harvard to the entirety of the depositions. Mark offers difficulty and unnecessary nitpicking comments, worsening his image that is already being tarnished by both lawsuits. The lawyers are patient but frustrated; Eduardo is resigned and used to it; the Winklevosses (well, Tyler) and Divya are incensed with Mark’s every cutting word.</p>

<p>And this attitude is intentional&mdash;to an extent. Mark knows that he is intelligent and on the path to success, stating forthright in the first scene that he got a 1600 on his SATs. He prides himself on his intellectual ability, insofar as much to be rude and sarcastic because he believes he has the privilege to act like this&mdash;he acts smarter than everyone else because he <i>is</i>. He uses his talent and genius as his ego kingpin&mdash;he is allowed to act like an asshole, because no matter his his personality, people will be envious of his brain anyway. And he wants that&mdash;that envy, attention, if people won’t like and accept him first.</p>

<p>But this is where his <u>need for acceptance</u> comes in, and comes in first. He only makes Facemash <i>after</i> his girlfriend dumps him and his friend suggests a project that sounds interesting to him, that can get him notoriety in exchange for Erica’s absence. When called in front of the ad board, he wishes to be recognized for “pointing out holes [in the] security,” citing this <i>after</i> mentioning that he's already apologized, as if his being recognized is more important than an apology. And when the Winklevosses first approach him, Mark does withhold his judgment and gives them a chance, though when he figures that their proposal is boring and unpromising, he moves on. </p>

<p>And yet, despite this self-entitlement, he has such a pervasive interest in creating Facebook as a social experience online. It's the idea of a final club where either he’s in one or making the club himself, and he approaches both with an open mind. He does not make Facebook as a vanity project: he wants it to be genuinely useful to others. Even though he walks around in his Adidas flip-flops with an air of elitism and self-reliant independence, he the support and input of Eduardo, or Sean, or Erica. He wants to be someone that people deliberately like and admire, or that they can’t help but be jealous of even if they dislike him. Mark is torn between these two intention-based insecurities, and there is very little in-between.</p>

<p>But most of all, Mark thrives on his <u>craftsmanship</u>. His academic prowess is one thing, but he prioritizes creating&mdash;the things <i>he</i> creates&mdash;more than anything else. With Facemash and the montage of his coding Facebook, we can see that he is excited in the process, so immersed and single-minded that he doesn’t sleep much or pay attention in Art History. He is ambitious and inventive; his high school project, Synapse, is briefly mentioned, something that he could’ve sold to Microsoft&mdash;and instead uploaded it to the internet for free. He does not create things to go places even if he knows he is. He creates things to create.</p>

<p>Like other characters of his archetype, his keen interest and talent in computer science aligns with his left-brained inclinations in his cutting and logically nitpicking dialogue. And yet there is a strong element of artistry and right-brain imagination in his work as well&mdash;during the DVD commentary, Eisenberg says that Mark sees himself “as both a scientist and an artist,” when it comes to Facebook; he prides himself on having a vast imagination and (eventual) billion-dollar ideas. He is a prolific, tunnel-visioned craftsman, and much of his natural self-worth lies with the things he <i>makes</i>, rather than he himself.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook, where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing. Did I adequately answer your condescending question?&rdquo;</h3>

<img src="mark/6.png" class="banner">

<h3>&ldquo;I know you've done your homework and so you know that money isn't a big part of my life, but at the moment I could buy Mt. Auburn Street, take the Phoenix Club, and turn it into my ping-pong room.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Mark’s trademark clothing are his ubiquitous hoodies (even during the depositions) and Adidas flip-flops with socks (khaki shorts, weather permitting), which more or less can be taken as his fashion apathy and lack of social graces. On top of that, most of his wardrobe are old high school t-shirts and jeans; and the script describes him as such:</p>
<blockquote>“...a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of any physically intimidating attributes masks a very complicated and dangerous anger. He has trouble making eye contact and sometimes it’s hard to tell if he’s talking to you or to himself.”</blockquote>
<p>… implicating that he knows not to try to impress with his physical appearance, when there is not much of his appearance to impress with in the first place. He makes no attempt to socially grace others with his physical presence; but at the same time, these parts of his wardrobe are so token to him that it could even make him be more comfortable in his identity to not care about them.</p>
<p>Additionally, during the “present” of the movie (the depositions), the script then has this description:</p>

<blockquote>“... wearing a hoodie, sweatpants and Adidas flip-flops--a personal uniform that we’ll come to understand. And while it may take us a while to notice it, MARK’s a different person in these flash-forward scenes. Still tortured and complicated, but comfortable now with his own power.”</blockquote>

<p>This discussion of “his own power” adds a further dimension to Mark’s character&mdash;amongst the pre-existing independence and withheld judgment, this future readjustment allows him to be settled with who he is now. It is not the <i>power</i> that identifies him, but that something that he made has thrived and been recognized by others. Mark lives with a head that constantly seeks to create more, for more to be <i>in</i> his life&mdash;and when he does reach that position in the future-present, he is more confident in his skin, as opposed to his sophomoric false confidence and “complicated and dangerous anger” as described in the beginning. He is comfortable <i>with</i> his power but not because of it; he has always been sure of who he was, but now he does not have to prove himself. </p>

<p>He does not want dominance; he does not crave to be in charge of others; he does not care about money. It is the work he does and the things he makes that he cares about, which is why fashion, healthy lifestyles, and even an education at the most renowned school in the United States, take a backseat. Mark does not feel fulfilled unless he is creating, unless those things are successful. And then after that it is other’s reactions, not his self-confidence, that he waits to come.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;I was drunk, and angry, and stupid... and blogging.&rdquo;</h3>

<img src="mark/4.png" class="banner">

<h3>&ldquo;It <b>is</b> better to be accused of necrophilia.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>In his tumultuous relationship with socializing and wanting acceptance, Mark values honesty in a relationship that he cares about&mdash;thus, his putting his foot in his mouth again and again when Erica breaks up with him and he tries to stop her. He demands things from Eduardo, and also seems to have an easy genial friendship with Dustin who is just as used to Mark’s biting quips. Mark evidently seeks a no-holds-barred back-and-forth relationship, not willing to be passive and withholding his opinions from people he values. Though it is often shown as rudeness, he sees it as the simple truth, even in its harsher ways.</p>

<p>At the same time, he approaches those whom he initially judges as unimpressive with this same brutal honesty, a defense mechanism that he’s long used to since his independence and intellect make him feel detached from others. While he wishes to connect with them on a personal basis, he instead creates things for others to use: because for him, making something convenient for others is easier than socializing and maintaining impressionable charisma and likability. This is why he is much more unhinged once he decides that someone is not worth his time&mdash;all claws are out. During the depositions he is an endless source of frustration to lawyers; with the Winklevosses he avoids and minimally replies to emails and ditches without even a two week’s notice; when Gage asks him if he thinks he deserves Mark's attention, Mark states his superior intellect outright. He is often scornful without intent; he expresses his pride without actively trying to hurt people, just to make them judge him the way he wants them to.</p>

<p>So on smaller scales he often comes off as aggressive&mdash;but largely, he does avoid conflict more than otherwise. When there is actual conflict (as opposed to petty insults), Mark gets upset and supresses himself. He tries to reconcile with Erica not once but twice; and he withdraws when Eduardo confronts him at the end. Despite his frequency to pick verbal fights with people he doesn’t care about (such as the Winklevosses and lawyers), he hates falling outs and failed relationships&mdash;it's a reminder that he is not naturally good at it in the first place, and he resorts to being passive when it would matter more to be assertive otherwise.</p>

<p>And yet he has the full capability to be humble, flustered, and modest, especially when it comes to strangers whom he doesn’t dislike right away. In spite of other claims, Mark does know at the very least how to be socially aware, capable, and kind, such as with Ashleigh (the sorority intern), and the kids who approached him after the Bill Gates lecture. This only leads into his being socially awkward, though, since he clearly wants to be likable but only manages to brush it off with disjointed sincerity. When he is still idol worshipping Sean, Mark is very passive to get Sean to like him, agreeing with what he says and being expressively impressed. There is no cutting edge to Mark when someone he doesn’t know well and wants to like him is involved&mdash;once he knows they do like him, he begins to let his criticisms and wit show. This leads to him highly valuing relationships with people he deeply trusts, and either ending up not being able to let go, or compartmentalizing the former ruined relationship entirely.</p>

<p>Moreover, this appreciation for others is directed usually to people he finds intelligent and talented, even if they are more or less intelligent or talented than he. Mark is easily capable of seeing the merit of varying skillsets&mdash;Eduardo and his meteorology and algorithms, Chris and his publicity work, Sean and his takeover of the music industry; Dustin, Marilyn, Christy, and very likely Erica. Mark harbors no self-comparison, but rather <i>likes</i> to surround himself by people he thinks are interesting and smart. This opens up a world of possibilities once he can get over his own ego; he acts like an asshole on the outside, but he knows he is not a bad person at heart.</p>

<h4>Headcanons/Insignificant Details Expanded</h4>

<ul><li>Mark does not multitask, necessarily, but he does not shut his senses off while he is in the middle of working; hence his ability to comprehend what other people are saying while he is doing something else. This also results in his listening to music while he codes, so his brain is focused on the single task and won’t get distracted by his other senses.</li>
<li>He got a 1600 (a perfect score) on his SATs.</li>
<li>He prefers beer to any other type of liquor, including fancy wines and champagnes.</li>
<li>He frequently eats Twizzlers and likes tuna (he eats it straight from the can in the movie.) Also, when he’s not drinking alcohol he usually gets Red Bull, due to an asininely inconsistent sleep schedule that occurs unintentionally but also frequently since he doesn’t look at the clock and then suddenly it’s four in the morning.</li>
<li>He works at desks only, not on his bed; in Harvard during the week/day he often works in the CS lab.</li>
<li>He is “not a hugger” as stated by Sean&mdash;he does not mind casual touching, but finds further platonic intimacy embarrassing and unnecessary.</li>
<li>He can blind-type semi-fluently, and mostly in lapslock. Otherwise he usually uses proper capitalization&mdash;though, of course, is prone to typos when drunk.</li>
<li>He knows that he is awful at drawing but if he has a pen and paper and isn’t allowed to do something that he actually wants to do (like text someone or code), he’ll doodle.</li>
<li>He sincerely believes that he did not steal the idea for Facebook from the Winklevosses&mdash;if anything, they <i>inspired</i> the initial exclusivity-social networking element of Facebook, but with different purposes and growth.</li></ul>
<h4>Factually</h4>
<ul><li>He has three sisters (one a year older and also went to Harvard, two younger.)</li>
<li>He is a (former) fencer, which usually implies firm thighs and decent posture, though Eisenberg’s acting basically nixes the latter.</li>
<li>He knows five languages and enjoys learning languages in general; the languages in question are English, Hebrew (writing), Greek (writing), Latin (writing), French, and Mandarin.</li>
<li>He is a dog person... or, at least, has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/beast.the.dog">a Puli named Beast</a>.</li></ul>
